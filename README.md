# Tiles AI

A phone-home-screen for your AI agents. A **board** is a grid of **tiles**; each
tile is an agent. Tap a tile and it turns **green** — running. Tiles AI is the
control plane around your agents: **register → activate → observe → permission →
(later) compose.** It is *not* another framework for writing agent logic — a
tile can wrap LangGraph, CrewAI, the OpenAI Agents SDK, or plain Python.

> **Status: v0, phases 1–3 done.** The contract (schemas, interfaces, lifecycle,
> permission tiers, brain resolution), the registry/loader, and the runtime
> stack (mock connector layer, model adapter, permission gate + approval queue)
> are in, with a working `read_only` reference tile and 67 tests. The FastAPI
> layer and React board come next. See [`SPEC.md`](SPEC.md).

## Why it exists

- **A tile is a contract, not a UI element.** The center of the project is a
  minimal, inspectable spec every tile satisfies.
- **Permissions are first-class.** Every tile declares a permission tier. Any
  real-world side effect defaults to human-in-the-loop. Green ≠ unsupervised.
- **Connect the brain once.** Configure an LLM provider once (hosted API or a
  local endpoint like Ollama); every tile uses it by default.
- **Inspectability is the win.** Read one reference tile end to end, copy the
  folder, implement one interface, done.

## The contract at a glance

```
Connector  = durable connection to one app (auth + tool surface). One per app.
Tile       = an agent on top: model + instructions + permission tier,
             bound to one connector, allow-listed to a subset of its tools.
Brain      = one global model provider config; tiles use it unless they pin one.
```

A connector is, in the general case, a binding to an app's **MCP** server. v0
ships a `mock` connector; a real MCP-backed one drops in without changing the
tile contract.

## Develop

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest
```

The whole contract is in [`src/tiles_ai/contracts/`](src/tiles_ai/contracts/).
Start with [`SPEC.md`](SPEC.md), then read the modules in this order:
`lifecycle` → `permissions` → `connector_manifest` → `tile_manifest` →
`provider_config` → `connector` → `tile` → `validation`.
